        Uses of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them control over the way that a page is displayed.
        It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means of marking up the structure of a document not as a
        way of determning its presentation.
		<br> </br>
	<br>	Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from
        formatting text to appear </br>
		<br> </br>
		in a printed document.
